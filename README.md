### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently a sophomore in the School of EECS at **Peking University**.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning *NLP basics*, *Information and Coding Theory*, and *Probability Theory*.
- 🙌 I’m looking forward to starting my journey **in academy**. (at least give it a try)  
- 😄 I'm intereted in the essence of how humanbeing make decisions and form their beliefs, and I prefer exploring this topic in a more ***technical*** way. (related to Computer Science, Game Theory, and more)
